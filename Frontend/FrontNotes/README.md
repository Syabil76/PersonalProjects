## Following a Tutorial
  As I started to learn go about 2 weeks ago (sometime July 2024), I noticed that often times, the fastest way to learn a language is to simply do it.
  After taking advice from reddit (yes I am serious) I had a four step program:
  - Follow a tutorial on youtube or website on how to do what I want to do
  - Read documentation on language / tools / libraries used
  - Reread code written from tutorial and comment to try to understand
  - Create something with skills learnt
## USAGE
  The design is very simple, taking about 2-3 hours to create
  * press the very conspicuous '+' button to create a note
  * press the very conspicuous 'trash' button to delete
  * press the very conspicuous 'pen' button to edit
  There you go!
## BUGS / PROBLEMS
  When a note is created, an overflow css statement is used so notes can be however long you want it to be.\
  However, the scroll bar used to navigate said long note is directly in the middle, will remedy soon...\
